# Status page for APIs

A simple status page for the APIs of Microserv.

Contains a list of available APIs, which tries to HTTP GET the API roots. Upon receiving the response, it'll generate a status icon (spinner, done or error). When clicking on an item in the list, documentation for that API will become available.
